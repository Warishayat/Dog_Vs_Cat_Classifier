# Dog vs. Cat Classifier

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats using a dataset from Kaggle. The model is trained to distinguish between two classes: dogs and cats.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a binary classifier that can accurately determine whether an image contains a dog or a cat. The dataset used consists of 2000 images (1000 for each class), which were processed and augmented to improve model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats). It contains:
- 1000 images of dogs
- 1000 images of cats

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dog-vs-cat-classifier.git
   cd dog-vs-cat-classifier
   ```

2. Ensure all dependencies are installed as per the requirements.

## Usage

To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will start the training process using the specified dataset and parameters.

## Model Architecture

The model is structured as follows:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Three convolutional layers with ReLU activation.
- **Max Pooling Layers**: Downsampling the feature maps to reduce dimensionality.
- **Flatten Layer**: Flattening the output from the convolutional layers.
- **Dense Layers**: 
  - One hidden dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
  - Output layer with a single neuron and sigmoid activation for binary classification.

```python
Model = Sequential()
Model.add(Conv2D(16, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation="relu", input_shape=(224, 224, 3)))
Model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
Model.add(Conv2D(32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation="relu"))
Model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
Model.add(Conv2D(64, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation="relu"))
Model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
Model.add(Flatten())
Model.add(Dense(128, activation="relu"))
Model.add(Dense(1, activation="sigmoid"))
```

## Results

After training for 15 epochs, the model achieved an accuracy of **87%** on the validation dataset.

## Future Work

- Experiment with more epochs and different learning rates.
- Implement transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet).
- Improve data augmentation techniques to enhance model generalization.
- Evaluate the model using additional metrics (precision, recall, F1 score).
